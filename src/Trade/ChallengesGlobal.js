          Global trade is not without its challenges. Countries must address
          issues like protectionism, geopolitical tensions, and environmental
          impact. Trade wars and tariffs can disrupt supply chains and hurt
          economic growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent events like the US-China trade war and Brexit have highlighted
          how geopolitical decisions affect trade. Climate change and
          sustainability concerns are also reshaping how nations approach trade
          policies.
