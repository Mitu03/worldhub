            Global trade is not without its challenges. Countries must address
            issues like protectionism, geopolitical tensions, and environmental
            impact. Trade wars and tariffs can disrupt supply chains and hurt
            economic growth.

            Recent events like the US-China trade war and Brexit have
            highlighted how geopolitical decisions affect trade. Climate change
            and sustainability concerns are also reshaping how nations approach
            trade policies.
