          <p>
            The economic impact of global trade is profound, affecting GDP
            growth, employment, and technological advancement. Countries that
            participate in international trade tend to experience faster
            economic growth compared to those with restricted trade policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trade enables countries to specialize in producing goods where they
            have a comparative advantage, leading to higher efficiency and
            innovation. For example, countries like Germany excel in
            high-quality engineering products, while others focus on
            agricultural exports or tech services.
