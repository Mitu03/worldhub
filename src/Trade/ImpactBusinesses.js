          Global trade presents businesses with opportunities to expand into new
          markets, increase revenue, and gain access to global talent and
          resources. However, it also exposes them to increased competition and
          regulatory challenges.

          Companies can now source raw materials from multiple countries,
          reducing costs while accessing global markets to sell their products.
          Multinational corporations like Apple and Toyota rely heavily on
          international trade for their supply chains and global sales.
