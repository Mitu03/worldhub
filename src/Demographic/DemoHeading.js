      <h1>What Are Demographics?</h1>
      <p>
        "Demographic data refers to statistical information about the
        characteristics of a population, such as age, gender, education, income,
        and geographic location. It plays a vital role in shaping policies,
        economic planning, and societal development. By analyzing demographic
        trends, we can predict population growth, assess healthcare needs, and
        identify educational and employment challenges."

        <h2>Why Demographic Data Matters</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Population Growth: </strong>Helps governments and
            organizations plan infrastructure, housing, and resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Healthcare Needs: </strong>Life expectancy and aging
            population data are crucial for building effective healthcare
            systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Education and Employment: </strong>Literacy rate and age
            distribution data help design targeted education and employment
            programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Economic Planning: </strong>Knowing income levels and
            population size supports budgeting and future development planning.

        <h2>Impact of Demographic Trends on Life</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Urbanization:</strong> Migration to cities influences
            housing demand, public services, and transportation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aging Population:</strong> Leads to higher healthcare costs
            and a greater focus on elder care services.

            <strong>Youthful Population:</strong> Increases demand for
            education, jobs, and skill development programs.
